                Sports betting has long been a popular activity in Ireland, with a rich tradition of wagering on horse
                racing, GAA, and football that dates back centuries. The Irish have always had a passionate relationship
                with sports, and betting has been an integral part of that culture.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Horse racing, in particular, has been central to Irish betting culture since the 18th century. The
                establishment of the Irish Turf Club in 1790 helped formalize racing and betting practices. Traditional
                bookmakers would set up at racecourses, creating the foundation of Ireland's betting industry.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The introduction of the Betting Act in 1931 regulated betting shops, and by the 1960s, high street
                bookmakers became commonplace across Ireland. The digital revolution of the 2000s transformed the
                landscape, with online betting platforms making wagering more accessible than ever before.

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                Today, Ireland has one of the most sophisticated and well-regulated betting markets in Europe, with
                strict licensing requirements ensuring player protection while maintaining the country's rich betting
                heritage.
